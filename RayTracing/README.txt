Ray Tracing Program Functionality
Emma Meersman
Graphics

Implemented functionality of ray tracing:

1. The image shows a white Lambertian snowman built of quadratic surfaces.
2. A silvery moon (directional light source) illuminates the scene. 
3. Point light sources have been added for artistic effect. 
4. Shadows have been implemented.
5. An infinite snowy ground plane is included in the scene.
6. The snowman has a carrot nose, made from a cone (quadratic surface) with a carrot-colored diffuse look.
7. The snowman is built from ellipsoids instead of spheres.
8. The snowman has a copper pot for a hat, made from a cylinder (quadratic surface) with ideally reflective material. It reflects a mysterious object.
9. The snowman has two "glass" eyes that partially reflect its surroundings.
10. The snowman's arms are made of icicles (though the image will render much faster if the arms are not included).
11. A blue-green aurora borealis illuminates the sky, created from rays that hit no objects.
12. Judging from the giant hole in the middle of the snowman, it could have been made by Calvin himself!
